			<p>Later I learned from Ghak, who had finally come to his tribesmen and returned with a party to rescue me, that the ryth, as it is called, pursued the Sagoths until it had exterminated the entire band.  Ghak was, of course, positive that I had fallen prey to the terrible creature, which, within Pellucidar, is truly the king of beasts.</p>

			<p>"I was a young man when the Plague came&mdash;twenty-seven years old; and I  lived on the other side of San Francisco Bay, in Berkeley. You remember  those great stone houses, Edwin, when we came down the hills from Contra  Costa? That was where I lived, in those stone houses. I was a professor  of English literature."</p>
